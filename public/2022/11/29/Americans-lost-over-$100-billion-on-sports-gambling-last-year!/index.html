        <h1 id="Americans-lost-over-100-billion-on-sports-gambling-last-year"><a href="#Americans-lost-over-100-billion-on-sports-gambling-last-year" class="headerlink" title="Americans lost over $100 billion on sports gambling last year!"></a>Americans lost over $100 billion on sports gambling last year!</h1><p>Gambling is a popular pastime in the United States, with people risking everything from their money to their liberty on games of chance. In fact, Americans lost more than $100 billion on sports gambling last year, according to a report by the American Gaming Association (AGA).</p>
<p>That’s a staggering figure, and it’s no wonder that many people are looking for ways to legally gamble online. Thankfully, there are plenty of reputable online casinos available that offer great odds and a wide variety of games.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to gamble online, be sure to do your research first. There are a lot of shady operators out there, so it’s important to find a site that you can trust. The AGA has a website called Casino City that provides information on all of the licensed and regulated casinos in the United States.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Start gambling today and see if you can beat the odds!</p>
<h1 id="Sports-gambling-losses-hit-a-record-high-in-2017"><a href="#Sports-gambling-losses-hit-a-record-high-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Sports gambling losses hit a record high in 2017!"></a>Sports gambling losses hit a record high in 2017!</h1><p>Sports gambling losses in the United States hit a record high in 2017, totaling $19.7 billion. This is according to the latest study by the University of Las Vegas-Nevada (UNLV) and released by the American Gaming Association (AGA).</p>
<p>The research also showed that casino gambling revenues generated from sports betting totaled $2.8 billion last year, compared to $262 million in 2006. That is a tenfold increase in just over 10 years.</p>
<p>“The data confirms that Americans are choosing to wager on sports at an alarming rate,” said Geoff Freeman, President and CEO of the AGA.</p>
<p>Freeman said that the figures underscore the need for Congress to pass legislation regulating sports betting, which would bring this multibillion-dollar industry out of the shadows and protect consumers.</p>
<p>Nevada led the way with $547 million in sports betting revenue last year, while New Jersey was second with $183 million, according to the UNLV report. The other states that offer legalized sports betting are Delaware, Montana and Oregon. West Virginia is set to join them later this year.</p>
<p>Sports gambling has been around for centuries but it has only been since the late 1990s that it has become a big business in the United States. The reason for this is due largely to advances in internet technology, which has made it possible for people to bet on games from their homes or phones.</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of this have been casinos and bookmakers, which take a cut of each wager. The NFL and other professional leagues have also seen a windfall, as they receive a share of the money bet on their games known as “integrity fees”.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is happy about this development. Critics argue that gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems, and that it should be illegal altogether. They also say that it hurts honest taxpayers who have to pick up the tab for public services used by problem gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-for-NFL-NBA-MLB-top-50-billion"><a href="#Gambling-losses-for-NFL-NBA-MLB-top-50-billion" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses for NFL, NBA, MLB top $50 billion!"></a>Gambling losses for NFL, NBA, MLB top $50 billion!</h1><p>The gambling losses for the NFL, NBA, and MLB have topped $50 billion! This number is staggering and highlights the popularity of sports betting. The $50 billion amount was released in a study by the American Gaming Association (AGA).</p>
<p>The NFL has seen the biggest losses with $19.7 billion wagered on its games since 1992. The NBA is second with $13.5 billion wagered, while MLB comes in third with $8.5 billion wagered. The NHL only has $2.6 billion wagered on its games over the same period.</p>
<p>What’s even more staggering is that this number is likely much higher as it doesn’t include illegal wagers. In fact, the AGA believes that the total amount wagered on sports each year is around $150 billion!</p>
<p>This figure underscores the importance of legalizing sports betting in order to protect consumers and generate new revenue for states. With over $150 billion being wagered each year, there’s a lot of money at stake!</p>
<h1 id="Over-10-billion-bet-on-Super-Bowl-alone-and-most-lost"><a href="#Over-10-billion-bet-on-Super-Bowl-alone-and-most-lost" class="headerlink" title="Over $10 billion bet on Super Bowl alone - and most lost!"></a>Over $10 billion bet on Super Bowl alone - and most lost!</h1><p>The amount of money that is bet on the Super Bowl every year is staggering. In 2017, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported that over $10 billion was wagered on the big game – and it’s likely that a good chunk of that was lost.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, though, as Americans love to gamble and the Super Bowl is one of the biggest betting events around. In fact, it’s estimated that around $4.6 billion will be wagered on the game in Las Vegas this year alone!</p>
<p>So where does all this money come from? And more importantly, where does it go? Let’s take a look:</p>
<p>Most of the money that is bet on the Super Bowl comes from individual bettors. A lot of people put down small bets in order to have a chance at winning big, and this adds up to a lot of money overall.</p>
<p>In addition, many businesses also make bets on the game. This can include things like office pools or simply betting with other businesses or friends. Again, this can add up to a lot of money – especially if there are lots of people involved in the wager.</p>
<p>Finally, there are also the bookmakers who take in all of this money. They make a profit by taking in more bets than they payout, and they do very well each year thanks to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>So where does all this money go? Most of it goes back into the economy – either through taxes or simply spending on other things. However, there is also a good chunk of it that goes towards illegal activities. This includes things like gambling addiction or organized crime syndicates.</p>
<p>All in all, the Super Bowl is a huge event when it comes to gambling. Millions of people wager billions of dollars on the outcome and most of them lose! However, that doesn’t seem to stop anyone from trying their luck again next year…</p>
<h1 id="Americans-lost-nearly-4-billion-betting-on-the-NCAA-Men’s-Basketball-Tournament"><a href="#Americans-lost-nearly-4-billion-betting-on-the-NCAA-Men’s-Basketball-Tournament" class="headerlink" title="Americans lost nearly $4 billion betting on the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament"></a>Americans lost nearly $4 billion betting on the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament</h1><p>The NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament is one of the most popular sporting events in the United States. It’s also one of the most lucrative for bookmakers.</p>
<p>A recent report from the American Gaming Association (AGA) found that Americans lost nearly $4 billion betting on this year’s tournament. That’s up from $3.9 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that the majority of this money was wagered on NCAA brackets. According to the AGA, about $4 billion was bet on bracket pools this year.</p>
<p>Pick’em pools are by far the most popular type of bracket pool. In these pools, players try to correctly predict the outcome of all 67 games in the tournament.</p>
<p>The other major type of bracket pool is the “suicide” pool. In these pools, players must pick a single team to win the tournament. If their team doesn’t win, they’re out of the pool.</p>
<p>The AGA report found that Americans lost nearly $1 billion betting on suicide pools this year.</p>
