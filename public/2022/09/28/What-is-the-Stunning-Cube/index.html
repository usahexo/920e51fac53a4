<h1 id="How-do-you-play-the-Stunning-Cube-Game"><a href="#How-do-you-play-the-Stunning-Cube-Game" class="headerlink" title="How do you play the Stunning Cube Game?"></a>How do you play the Stunning Cube Game?</h1><p>The Stunning Cube Game is a dexterity-based game in which players must remove all of the cubes from the game board. The game board has various shaped slots in which the cubes can be placed, and each cube has a different shaped hole on one side. Players must use their fingers to remove the cubes by placing them into the matching slots on the game board.</p>
<p>The first player to remove all of the cubes from the game board wins the game. If at any time a cube becomes stuck, that player loses the game.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-set-up-the-Stunning-Cube-Game"><a href="#How-do-you-set-up-the-Stunning-Cube-Game" class="headerlink" title="How do you set up the Stunning Cube Game?"></a>How do you set up the Stunning Cube Game?</h1><p>To set up the Stunning Cube Game, players must first choose a color for their cubes. There are six colors available: blue, green, orange, purple, red, and yellow.</p>
<p>Next, players must place all of the cubes into the designated spot on the game board. The game board has 12 rows of slots, with each row containing three different shaped slots. There are also three triangular shaped slots in the middle of the game board.</p>
<p>Players must then place their colored cube into one of the triangular shaped slots in order to begin play.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play-the-Stunning-Cube-Game-1"><a href="#How-do-you-play-the-Stunning-Cube-Game-1" class="headerlink" title="How do you play the Stunning Cube Game?"></a>How do you play the Stunning Cube Game?</h1><p>To play the Stunning Cube Game, players must first decide who will go first. The player with the green cube goes first.</p>
<p>The object of the game is to remove all of the cubes from the game board. Players can only remove cubes that are not sticking out of any other slot on the game board. If at any time a cube becomes stuck, that player loses and their opponent automatically wins.</p>
<p>The player’s turn consists of two parts: moving and removing cubes. On a player’s turn they may move one cube at a time in any direction except downwards off of the bottom row of slots on to either an opponent’s cube or an empty slot on their own game board (if they have already played their last cube). </p>
<p>After moving a cube, that player then removes it if they can by placing it into one of matching shaped holes on their own game board. If at any point during gameplay there are no more legal moves for a player (such as all of their cubes being stuck), then they lose and their opponent automatically wins.</p>
<p>The first player to remove all of their own cubes from their gameboard wins!</p>
