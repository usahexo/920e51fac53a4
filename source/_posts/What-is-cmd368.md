#  Where is Egypt?

Egypt is a North African country bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of the most populous countries in Africa and the Middle East, and the 15th-most-populous country in the world. The majority of its population lives near the banks of the Nile River, an area that was first settled during the Neolithic period.

# History

The first ancient Egyptians were hunter-gatherers who settled along the Nile River Valley circa 6000 BCE. They developed a sedentary lifestyle based on agriculture and livestock husbandry, and subsequently began to cultivate crops and domesticate animals. The first Egyptian pharaohs emerged in c. 3100 BCE, initiating centuries-long periods of dynastic rule that gave rise to some of antiquity's most impressive monuments, including the pyramids at Giza. In 332 BCE, Egypt was conquered by Alexander the Great; his death in 323 BCE led to three successive wars between his generals over control of the country. In 30 BCE, Egypt became a province of Rome.

Following centuries of imperial rule by Rome, Byzantium, Arabia, and Persia, Egypt was conquered by Ottoman Turks in 1517 CE. The country remained under Ottoman control until it declared independence from Turkey in 1922 CE. After a period of British occupation (1882-1922 CE), Egypt became a republic in 1953 CE. President Gamal Abdel Nasser served as Egypt's first head of state, followed by Anwar Sadat and Mohamed Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak was ousted from power during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution; Mohamed Morsi succeeded him as president but was removed from office by military coup d'Ã©tat in 2013. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been president since 2014.

Since its independence in 1922 CE, Egypt has undergone a series of political transformations resulting in an autocratic government with limited civil rights. Human rights organizations have documented widespread violations by security forces including torture, arbitrary arrests and detentions, extrajudicial killings, sexual harassment and assault against women protesters, infringements on freedom of speech and assembly, and restrictions on religious freedom.[1] However, there have been some improvements under Sisi's rule: for example child labor has been reduced and access to education has increased.[2]

#  What inspired cmd368's creation?

cmd368 was created out of a need for an aggregated news source for the esports community. As someone who follows the industry closely, I found it difficult to track all of the latest news and announcements across the different games.
