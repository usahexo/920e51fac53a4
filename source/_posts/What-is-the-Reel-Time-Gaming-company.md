# How do you play the hand games?

There are many different hand games that can be played, but the basic idea behind all of them is to make the best five-card hand possible. The rank of the cards will determine the winner, with Aces being the highest and 2s being the lowest. Straights and flushes count as higher hands than pairs or singles.

Some games, such as poker, allow players to bet on their hands. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins all of the money that has been bet. In games like this, it is important to remember that not all hands are created equal. For example, a pair of kings is better than two pairs of 2s.

Other hand games do not involve betting, but simply seeing who can make the best hand. In this type of game, players usually ante up before each round in order to ensure that there is something at stake. The winner takes the pot at the end of the game.

There are a variety of different variants of these games, so it is important to understand the specific rules before playing. It is also important to know which cards are wild and which ones are not. Some games allow players to swap cards in order to create a better hand, while others do not.

# How do you play Gin Rummy?

The aim of Gin Rummy is to score points by making melds - three or four cards of consecutive rank - and/or setting aside cards into Runs (groups of three or more cards in sequence). The player who ends up with most points wins the game.

    The first player draws two cards from their deck and sets one face-up on top of their face-down deck - this is their Discard Pile . They then take another card from their deck and place it face-up next to their Discard Pile , this is their Hand .




Each player then either draws a card from their opponent's Discard Pile or takes one from their Hand (if they have no cards left in their Deck ) and discards one card from their Hand into their opponent's Discard Pile . This process continues until there are no more cards in either player's Deck or Hand .



 At this point each player picks up any remaining cards from their opponent's Discard Pile and adds them to their Hand . These then become that player's new Deck .



 The play now passes to the opposing player who must draw two fresh cards from their Deck and set them out as above. Play then proceeds as normal taking turns clockwise around the table.
