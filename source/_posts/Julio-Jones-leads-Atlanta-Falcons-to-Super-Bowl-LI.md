#  Julio Jones leads Atlanta Falcons to Super Bowl LI

The Atlanta Falcons are heading to Super Bowl LI after defeating the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship game. Julio Jones was the star of the game, catching nine passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns.

The Falcons started the game strong, scoring on their first drive and taking a 10-0 lead. The Packers made a comeback in the second half, but it was not enough to overcome Atlanta’s lead.

This is the Falcons’ second trip to the Super Bowl; they lost to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII. The Patriots are making their ninth trip to the Super Bowl, and they are looking for their fifth championship.

Super Bowl LI will be played on Sunday, February 5th at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.

#  Matt Ryan, Devonta Freeman power Atlanta Falcons past Green Bay Packers

The Atlanta Falcons were powered to a 44-21 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday by quarterback Matt Ryan and running back Devonta Freeman.

Freeman was in vintage form, rushing for 152 yards and three touchdowns on just 20 carries. Ryan, meanwhile, completed 27 of 36 passes for 392 yards and four touchdowns.

Julio Jones also had a big game for Atlanta, catching nine passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns.

The win improves the Falcons to 4-3 on the season, while the Packers fall to 4-3.

#  Atlanta Falcons relying heavily on ground game

The 2017 Atlanta Falcons are a team that is relying heavily on their ground game. Led by running back Devonta Freeman, the Falcons have the sixth-best rushing attack in the NFL, averaging 122.6 yards per game.

However, the Falcons’ offense has not been as consistent as they would like. Quarterback Matt Ryan has thrown nine interceptions this season – two more than he threw all of last season. To help take some pressure off of Ryan, the Falcons need to continue to run the ball effectively.

 Freeman has been one of the best running backs in the NFL over the past few seasons. He led the league in rushing touchdowns in 2016 and is currently third in the NFL with six rushing touchdowns this season. He is also averaging 4.8 yards per carry, which is sixth best among running backs with at least 50 carries.

The Falcons have also gotten solid production from their backup running backs Tevin Coleman and Terron Ward. Coleman is averaging 4.4 yards per carry and has two rushing touchdowns this season. Ward is averaging 5.5 yards per carry and has one rushing touchdown this season.

If the Falcons can continue to run the ball effectively, it will take some pressure off of Ryan and help them win more games down the stretch.

#  Dwight Freeney looking to add another title with Atlanta Falcons

Dwight Freeney is no stranger to Super Bowl titles. The former Indianapolis Colts linebacker is looking to add a second with the Atlanta Falcons.

Freeney has had an illustrious career, winning one Super Bowl with the Colts in 2006 and making 11 Pro Bowls. The 36-year-old has also been named first-team All-Pro three times.

Now in his 16th season, Freeney is still going strong. He had 3.5 sacks this year for the Falcons and played a big role in their run to the Super Bowl.

Atlanta will face the New England Patriots in Houston on Sunday. It will be a tough matchup for the Falcons, but they have a chance if they can get pressure on Tom Brady. That's where Freeney will be important.

He may not be as fast as he once was, but Freeney still has a lot of talent and knows how to get to the quarterback. If he can have a big game against the Patriots, it could be the difference maker.

This could be Freeney's last chance at another Super Bowl title, so he'll be trying his best to make sure Atlanta wins.

#  Deion Jones leads Atlanta Falcons defense

Atlanta Falcons linebacker Deion Jones is one of the best players in the NFL. He is the leader of the Falcons defense and he makes a big impact on the field.

Jones was drafted by the Falcons in 2016 and he has been a big part of their defense ever since. He had a breakout season in 2017 and he was named to the Pro Bowl.

Jones is a talented player who can make plays all over the field. He is a sure tackler and he also has great speed and athleticism. He is a major asset to the Falcons defense.

The Falcons rely on Jones to make big plays and he has certainly delivered this season. He has been one of the top defenders in the NFL and he will play a key role in Atlanta’s pursuit of a Super Bowl title.
