#  PokerStars Casino to Acquire Microgaming's HackSaw Casino

Leading online poker site PokerStars Casino has announced its intent to acquire the assets of Microgaming's HackSaw casino. The move is seen as a strategic one for PokerStars, as it expands its casino offering and gains a foothold in the competitive iGaming market.

HackSaw is a well-known and well-respected name in the online casino industry, with a strong roster of games and an impressive track record of paying out winnings to players. PokerStars Casino spokesperson Laurence Escalante said that the company is excited to add HackSaw's games to its own library and praised them for their commitment to player satisfaction.

Escalante also highlighted the importance of the acquisition for PokerStars in light of recent changes in the iGaming market.

Microgaming CEO Roger Raatgever expressed his approval of the sale, stating that HackSaw will be in good hands with PokerStars.
