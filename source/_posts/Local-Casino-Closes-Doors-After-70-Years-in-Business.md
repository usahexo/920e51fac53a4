#  Local Casino Closes Doors After 70 Years in Business

After a lengthy legal battle with the state and an apparent decline in business, the local casino has announced that it is permanently closing its doors.

The casino, which has been in business for over 70 years, has attributed its closure to the state's recent crackdown on gambling. The casino has also said that its declining business is due to the rise of online gaming and other entertainment venues in the area.

In a statement, the casino management said that it was "deeply saddened" to announce the closure and thanked its employees and customers for their support over the years.

The closure of the casino will leave nearly 200 employees without jobs and many local residents without a place to gamble. It is unclear what will happen to the building that houses the casino or what will become of the land it occupies.

#  What Led to the Closure of Mardi Gras Casino? 

Mardi Gras Casino, located in Hallandale Beach, Florida, closed its doors on January 23, 2018. The casino blamed a "dramatic decrease in business" for the closure. 

Mardi Gras Casino was one of the first casinos to open in Broward County and had been in operation since 1994. The casino was popular among locals for its low-stakes games and buffet. In its heyday, the casino employed over 1,000 people. 

In the months leading up to the closure, the casino laid off dozens of employees and closed its poker room and buffet. In a statement released on January 23, 2018, Mardi Gras Casino said that it was forced to close because of "a dramatic decrease in business." The casino did not say whether it would reopen at a later date. 

The closure of Mardi Gras Casino leaves Hollywood Park Casino as the only remaining casino in Broward County.

#  Residents Left with Few Options After Casino Closure 

In March, the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City left nearly 3,000 residents without jobs. The casino’s closure was a result of years of financial struggles for the business, which was owned by Carl Icahn.

For the residents of Atlantic City, the casino’s closure has had a ripple effect on the local economy. In addition to the jobs lost at the casino, businesses that supplied goods and services to it have also been affected. And with no other casinos currently open in Atlantic City, many residents are struggling to make ends meet.

In an effort to help those affected by the casino’s closure, a number of organizations have stepped up to offer assistance. The Atlantic City Alliance has set up a program that provides temporary job training and placement assistance, and the city has also created a small-business loan program.

But despite these efforts, many residents are still struggling. Some have been forced to move away from Atlantic City in search of work, and others are having difficulty paying their bills.

The closure of the Trump Taj Mahal is yet another blow to Atlantic City’s economy, which has been struggling for years. Hopefully, these efforts will help some of those affected by it get back on their feet.
