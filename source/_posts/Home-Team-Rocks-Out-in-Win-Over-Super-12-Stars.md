#  Home Team Rocks Out in Win Over Super 12 Stars

The home team put on an impressive display to win over the visiting Super 12 squad. The game was close early on, with each side scoring a try in the first 10 minutes, but the home side took control soon after. They added two more tries in each of the next two quarters to take a commanding 28-5 lead into the final stages. Although the Super 12 side scored a late consolation try, it was not enough as the home team ran out winners by 33-10.

The star of the show for the home side was their flyhalf, who kicked conversions for all four of their tries and also impressed with his playmaking skills. His opposite number, who is normally one of the best players in the Super 12 competition, had a quiet game by comparison.

The victory was especially satisfying for the home side as they had lost to this same Super 12 side earlier in the season. It proves that they are now capable of beating anyone in this competition and should make a deep run into the playoffs.
