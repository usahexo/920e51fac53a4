#  Playing Pompeii Slot Machine – What You Need to Know

Are you interested in playing Pompeii slot machine? If so, this is the right article for you. In this piece, we will discuss everything you need to know in order to play the game. So, without further ado, let’s get started!

The Basics of Pompeii Slot Machine

Pompeii slot machine was created by Aristocrat and it is a five-reel and three-row video slot with twenty fixed paylines. The game is set in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii which was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Symbols on the reels include various artifacts from that period such as scrolls, helmets, vases and coins. The game also has two bonus features – the free spins bonus and the avalanche feature.

Playing Pompeii Slot Machine

In order to play Pompeii slot machine, you will first need to decide how many paylines you want to bet on. You can do this by using the (+) and (-) buttons at the bottom of the screen. Once you have done this, you can then choose your coin value by using the (+) and (-) buttons next to “Coin Value”. You can bet between 1c and $10 per payline. So, if you want to bet on all 20 paylines, your total bet would be $200 per spin.

Once you have placed your bets, hit “Spin” to start the game. Alternatively, you can use the Autoplay function to let the game spin for a predetermined number of rounds. If you land three or more of the scatter symbols anywhere on the reels, you will trigger the free spins bonus round where you can win up to 25 free spins. Additionally, any winning combinations that occur during the free spins will be multiplied by 3x. The avalanche feature is also activated during free spins mode which means that winning symbols explode and new symbols fall into their place for potentially more wins.

If you land three or more of the wild symbols anywhere on the reels, you will trigger the avalanche feature which will award one free respin with all winning symbols held in place. If another wild symbol appears during respin mode, an additional respin is awarded. The avalanche feature continues until no new wild symbols appear which means that there could potentially be multiple respins awarded.
