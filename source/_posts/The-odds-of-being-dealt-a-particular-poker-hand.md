#  The best five poker hands in order from strongest to weakest

Poker hands are ranked in order from the strongest to the weakest.

The strongest hand is a royal flush, which consists of the ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit. A royal flush is an extremely rare hand that can only be formed when all five cards are of the same rank.

The second strongest hand is a straight flush, which is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit. A straight flush is less rare than a royal flush but still significantly harder to get than other poker hands.

Third place goes to four of a kind, which consists of four cards of the same rank. This hand is also relatively rare but not as hard to get as a royal flush or straight flush.

Fourth place goes to a full house, which is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. Full houses are quite common in poker and can be formed with any combination of different suits.

Last place goes to two pairs, which consists of two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand is also quite common in poker and can be formed with any combination of different suits.

#  The rarest five poker hands in order from most to least rare

In poker, every card is dealt out from a deck of 52 cards. This means that there are 2,598,960 possible five-card hands.

While most hands are relatively common, there are a few that are significantly rarer. Here is a list of the five rarest poker hands in order from most to least rare:

1. Royal flush
2. Straight flush
3. Four of a kind
4. Full house
5. Flush

#  How often each poker hand is likely to be dealt

In poker, every player is dealt two cards face down and there are five community cards that are placed in the middle of the table. The remaining players then take it in turns to either bet or fold. The game is won by the player who has the best hand, with the Royal Flush being the highest ranking hand.

While there are many different variations of poker, the hands ranking are typically the same. In this article we will take a look at how often each hand is likely to be dealt and what you need to do in order to win.

The most common hand in poker is two pair, which is dealt around 22% of the time. This is followed by three of a kind (17%), then a straight (15%), and then a flush (13%). The least common hand is four of a kind, which is only dealt around 1% of the time.

In order to win poker, you will need to have one of the following hands: Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a kind or two pair.

If you have two pair or less, then you will need to hope that the other player doesnâ€™t have anything better. If you have three of a kind or better, then you will want to bet as much as possible in order to maximise your chances of winning.
