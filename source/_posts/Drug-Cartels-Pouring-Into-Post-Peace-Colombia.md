#  Drug Cartels Pouring Into Post-Peace Colombia

The south American country of Colombia has been enjoying a period of peace and stability since 2016, when the government signed a historic peace accord with the leftist rebel group FARC. However, this newfound peace is now being threatened by the influx of drug cartels from neighboring Venezuela.

Venezuela has been in the grip of a humanitarian crisis for years, with widespread poverty and political instability leading to a massive surge in crime. criminals and gangsters have taken advantage of the situation to establish powerful drug cartels, which are now spreading into Colombia.

In particular, the Cartel de los Soles is believed to be behind much of the drug trafficking activity in Colombia. This cartel is said to be closely aligned with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and has been implicated in numerous human rights abuses.

The Colombian government has responded to the threat posed by thecartels by deploying troops to the border region and stepping up security measures. However, it is clear that more needs to be done to combat this growing menace.

The United States must play a role in helping Colombia deal with these drug cartels, as they represent a serious threat not just to Colombia but also to US national security. The Trump administration should provide financial and military assistance to the Colombian government so that it can properly address this problem.

#  What Does a Blackjack Payout Look Like in a Country Where Cocaine is King?

Casinos have been in the news a lot lately, but for all the wrong reasons. In the small town of Bắc Ninh in northern Vietnam, a casino was raided and Vietnamese police seized nearly 2 million euros worth of cocaine. 

This is just one recent example in a long line of casinos being implicated in drug trafficking schemes. The Macau casino magnate Stanley Ho was convicted of running a heroin smuggling ring out of his casinos in 2001. In 2007, an Australian man was caught trying to smuggle cocaine into a casino in Macau. And in 2014, two Canadian men were arrested at the Manila airport with 6 kilograms of cocaine destined for a casino there.

Why do casinos seem to be so popular among drug traffickers? One possible explanation is that the high stakes and sensory overload of casinos create an environment where people can easily lose track of what's going on around them. This may make them more susceptible to being duped by drug dealers into carrying drugs home unknowingly.

Another possibility is that casinos offer a great cover for drug trafficking operations. Because they are legal and highly regulated, it's easier to move drugs through casinos without arousing suspicion. And because gambling is often seen as shady or criminal, it's less likely that anyone will question what someone is doing if they're seen going into or coming out of a casino late at night.

Whatever the reasons may be, one thing is clear: casinos are a hotbed for drug trafficking activity. And with cocaine becoming increasingly popular around the world, it's likely that we'll see more cases like the one in Bắc Ninh in the years to come.

#  Will Tourism Take Off in Colombia with its Newfound Peace?

Tourism is steadily becoming one of the most important global industries. In 2017, it accounted for 10 percent of the world's GDP and is forecast to grow at a rate of 4 percent per year through 2021. 

A big reason for this growth is that people are traveling more than ever before. The UNWTO's 2018 report on the state of the global tourism industry found that 1.323 billion people traveled internationally in 2017, up from 1.235 billion in 2016. This was also the seventh consecutive year of above-average growth.

The rise in tourism is benefiting many destinations around the world, but some countries are reaping more rewards than others. Colombia is one such country.

Thanks to its newfound peace, Colombia is quickly becoming a popular tourist destination. In 2017, the country saw a 20 percent increase in international arrivals, with a total of 5.8 million tourists visiting. And in 2018, arrivals are expected to grow by another 20 percent to 7 million visitors.

This surge in tourism is welcome news for Colombia, which has long been struggling to boost its economy. In fact, just a few years ago, tourism accounted for only 2 percent of Colombia's GDP.

So why is Colombia seeing such an increase in tourism? There are several reasons.

First, word has spread about how beautiful Colombia is and its many tourist attractions, which include mountains, jungles, beaches, and colonial towns. Second, the country has become much safer since former president Alvaro Uribe took office in 2002 and began cracking down on the drug cartels. Finally, the Colombian peso has devalued against other currencies over the past few years, making it a more affordable destination for international travelers. 

Despite these positive developments, there are some potential challenges that could affect Colombia's booming tourism industry. One is that much of the country's infrastructure is still not ready to handle such large numbers of tourists. For example, there is a lack of quality hotels and restaurants outside of Bogota and Cartagena. And while security has improved in recent years, there are still some areas where visitors should take precautions. 

Nevertheless, Colombian officials are optimistic about the country's prospects as a tourist destination. They believe that with continued investment in infrastructure and security, tourism will continue to grow at a rapid pace, providing much-needed economic relief to the country's struggling economy

#  What Effects Will the End of War Have on the Illegal Drug Trade?

For nearly a century, war has been one of the biggest drivers of the illegal drug trade. But with the end of war in sight, what will happen to the drug trade?

According to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) data, about 87 percent of global cocaine production takes place in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. These countries have been locked in a decades-long battle against cocaine production and trafficking.

The end of war is likely to change this landscape. With less need for money to fund armies, it is possible that these three countries could see a decline in cocaine production. This would likely lead to a decline in cocaine prices and increased availability of the drug on the black market.

Other drugs are also likely to be affected by the end of war. For example, opium production is concentrated in Afghanistan, where the ongoing conflict has helped to fuel the illegal drug trade. With peace restored, it is likely that opium production will decline, leading to increased prices and decreased availability of opiates on the black market.

So what does all this mean for drug users? In short, it means that drugs are likely to become more expensive and more difficult to obtain. However, it is important to remember that the effects of the end of war will not be uniform across all drugs – each drug will be affected differently depending on its production location and market dynamics.

It is also worth noting that while war may have fuelled the illegal drug trade in the past, it is not the only factor at play. Social dynamics, demographics and cultural factors also play a role in determining demand for drugs. As such, it is impossible to predict exactly how the end of war will affect global drug markets.

Nevertheless, it is clear that the current landscape is changing, and that drug users should brace themselves for significant changes in the years ahead.

#  Withdrawing Rebel Forces, What's Next for Colombia?

In early November, Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos announced the beginning of a withdrawal of rebel forces from the country as part of a peace agreement reached with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The withdrawal began on November 19 and is expected to be completed by mid-December. What does this mean for Colombia? And what's next for the peace process?

The peace agreement between the Colombian government and FARC was reached in late September, after four years of negotiations. It calls for the rebels to disarm and demobilize, and for survivors of the conflict to receive reparations. In return, FARC will be granted an equal number of seats in both houses of Congress.

Opposition to the peace agreement has been strong, with many Colombians fearing that FARC will not be held accountable for their crimes. However, Santos has said that the agreement is not perfect, but that it is better than continued war.

The withdrawal of rebel forces is seen as a critical step towards implementation of the peace agreement. It is hoped that it will build trust between the government and FARC and lay the groundwork for political negotiations to follow.

The next step in the peace process is a plebiscite on ratification of the agreement, which is scheduled for December 2. If passed, it will be up to Congress to implement its provisions.
