#  Gambler wins big in casino keno game 

There was a bit of a commotion at the casino keno game last night as one lucky gambler walked away with a huge jackpot. Players were lining up to get their tickets, but only one managed to score the big win.

Many were surprised when the man calmly collected his winnings and walked out of the casino. He had just won over $250,000 on a single bet!

Casino officials say that this is one of the largest payouts they have seen in some time. They are still trying to figure out who the lucky gambler was, as no one seems to know who he is.

This is just another reminder that you can never predict who will win big in casino games. So if you're feeling lucky, why not try your hand at keno? You might be the next person to walk away with a life-changing jackpot!

#  Keno player scoops $100,000 jackpot 

The player, who has asked to remain anonymous, said they only decided to play Keno on Saturday night because the jackpot was so large. “I never usually play Keno, but when I saw the $100,000 jackpot I thought it was worth a go,” the player said.

The player purchased a ticket for the game at 7:30pm and watched as the numbers were drawn. They didn’t think they had won anything until a friend rang them up with the good news. “I just couldn’t believe it when she told me – I still can’t quite get my head around it,” the player said.

This is the second big win for this player – in October last year they won $10,000 from a scratchie. They said they plan to use their latest win to pay off some debts and take a holiday.

Keno is a lottery game that is played in Australia and many other countries around the world. In Keno, players select between one and 10 numbers, depending on the variant of the game being played. 20 balls are then randomly drawn from a pool of 80 balls, and if any of the player's chosen numbers are among those drawn, they are awarded a prize.

#  Woman wins nearly $50,000 playing casino keno 

A woman visiting a casino in Las Vegas, Nevada hit a major jackpot this week, winning nearly $50,000 while playing the keno game. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was visiting the casino with her husband when she decided to try her luck at the keno game.

After placing a bet of $5, the woman quickly began winning numbers left and right. Within minutes, she had won the jackpot prize of $49,840. Her husband could not believe his eyes as he watched his wife win one number after another.

When asked what she planned to do with her winnings, the woman said that she and her husband were going to use the money to take a much-needed vacation. "We've been wanting to go on a trip for a while now, and this really helps us out," she said. "I'm just so happy that I was able to hit the jackpot."

The woman's lucky streak is just another example of how Lady Luck can smile down on players who are trying their luck at casino games. Whether you're playing slots, blackjack or poker, always remember that it's important to have fun and stay positive. Who knows - you might just be the next person to hit the jackpot!

#  Couple cashes in on $25,000 casino keno win 

For most people, winning $25,000 would be a life-changing event. But for one Michigan couple, it was simply the latest installment in a series of big payouts they've enjoyed at casino keno tables.

The pair has now cashed in on more than $100,000 worth of keno wins in the past year alone, and they say their secret to success is to always bet the maximum allowed.

"We always play the maximum $6 a game," said the husband. "And we've been pretty lucky."

Their latest win came at Palace Station Casino in Las Vegas, where they were playing a game that offered a top prize of $25,000. After hitting that jackpot, they immediately took their winnings and headed to the slots to try and parlay their luck there as well.

"It's been a really good year for us," said the wife. "Our keno fortunes have really turned around."

#  Keno player scores massive $10,000 win

A keno player in Nevada hit a massive $10,000 jackpot at the weekend, in what has been hailed as the biggest win at the casino in recent times.

The lucky player, who has not been identified, was playing at the Sands Casino Resort when they successfully hit the jackpot on a game of keno.

According to local media reports, the ecstatic player could not believe their good fortune, screaming with joy as they realised they had just become a millionaire.

The win is thought to have come as something of a surprise to the player, who only bets $2 per game.

Executive Vice President for Gaming at Sands Casino Resort, Robert Goldstein, praised the lucky winner, saying "We are thrilled that one of our guests hit such a large jackpot this weekend. This demonstrates that anyone can hit it big while playing any game at our property."



The news of the huge win comes as a welcome relief to players across Nevada, who have had a frustrating few months when it comes to slot machine payouts. In February, The Las Vegas Sun reported that slot machine payouts in Nevada casinos were down by 6 percent year-on-year.

This isn't the first time that a keno player has hit it big in Nevada either - back in November 2015, another player scooped an impressive $50,000 prize from a single game.
